//TODO Add popular progressions from hooktheory (https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/common-chord-progressions)
//TODO - embed key and time signature changes in the first note (they are no different than controller events). This will allow us to append tracks with different keys and time signatures and have the notation come out correctly.
//TODO - analyze chord progression, and note which scales would fit a chord based on its pitches.
//key modulation - give starting key and root tone (e.g., C Major V), specify target chord and (optionally) the number of steps to make the transition?
BOOK TWO
//TODO?? Chapter 2 - support for root tone+interval C3 2,2,1 for representing pitch, in addition to the current pitch method -- C4, Db5, etc.
//TODO?? - Pitch scale expansion.

//TODO - autocompute how much of a track needs to be generated in order to be used in another track.

//TODO - sections. Songs of certain genres have specific forms. e.g., pop songs have sections A B A' B C B'. Each section lasts a certain number of bars, and has a chord progression. That's nice, but what could Schilz do to help? 
	We can help make a track fit in a certain number of bars with a certain time signature, by computing the beatUnit.
	

//TODO Musical Forms...
if (rhythms.tracks[j].type == 'form') {
//a form track is a set of timeSignature, tempo, key and/or chord changes.
//
			//with forms, we might be moving past the original intent of Schilz into the realm of 'automated composition'. But maybe not...
			//a form consists of nested sections.
			//if a form is specified, I think it has to be executed first, so that the basic structure can be laid out and the subsequent rhythms fit into it.
			//but what does it mean to lay out the basic structure?
			//Well, for one, if we're creating a chord progression, then there has to be a rhythm track with the chords and associated scale laid out. We can then specify that a track is to be auto-transposed, in line with the chords and/or scales that have been laid out in this base track.
			//We can have tracks that are motifs or phrases--they can be hand-made, or an entire other track or snippet thereof.
		} else 
		
		//TODO - before (or instead of) getting into the whole forms, etc. thing, maybe it would be better if we started out by doing more computations to help the composer understand how their choices come together? For example, can we have vertical separators in the chart to show sections? Can we compute statistics to show how many repetitions are needed for things to complete within the current section (LCM)?
